## Fail2ban:

Written in Python, Fail2ban is a free and open-source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that protects the server against brute-force attacks. Fail2ban is a log-parsing security tool that protects Linux systems from brute-force attacks by monitoring log files and banning IPs that show malicious behavior, such as too many password failures.



### Common Use Cases:
- SSH brute-force protection
- Web server attacks (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- FTP/Dovecot/Postfix authentication attacks
- WordPress or other CMS login abuse



### Enable `firewalld`:
The first thing to be done is enable the firewall, so the fail2ban service can successfully run.  

If you're using Fail2ban with the default configuration on Rocky Linux, then `firewalld` must be running — because Fail2ban uses `firewalld` as the default firewall backend.

| firewalld Status | Fail2ban Works?   | Requires Configuration?  |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Running**      | ✅ Yes             | ❌ No                     |
| **Stopped**      | ❌ No (by default) | ✅ Yes (change banaction) |



#### If firewalld is running:
- Fail2ban will work out of the box.
- IPs will be banned using `firewall-cmd`.
- No extra configuration needed.
- Recommended: Keep `firewalld` running

#### If firewalld is stopped or disabled:
- Fail2ban will not block IPs unless you manually change the ban action to use `iptables` or `nftables`.



```
systemctl unmask firewalld
```


```
systemctl enable firewalld
systemctl start firewalld

systemctl status firewalld
```



```
firewall-cmd --list-all
```



### Install Fail2ban:

```
yum install -y epel-release

yum install -y fail2ban fail2ban-systemd
```



```
systemctl enable fail2ban
systemctl start fail2ban

systemctl status fail2ban
```


```
fail2ban-server -V

fail2ban-client -V
```



```
fail2ban-client get loglevel


Current logging level is 'INFO'
```


```
fail2ban-client get logtarget


Current logging target is:
`- /var/log/fail2ban.log
```






### Configuration Fail2ban: 

- fail2ban configurations are exist in `/etc/fail2ban` and `/etc/fail2ban/jail.d`
- fail2ban reads `*.conf` files first and then reads `*.local` files. Therefore, all settings in `*.conf` files are override by the settings in `*.local` files.
- Thus, it is a **best practice to create a custom** `jail.local` file instead of editing the default `jail.conf` file.
- fail2ban provides only a single configuration file `/etc/fail2ban/jail.conf` with initial configurations. This file contains sample jail configurations of common network services. Therefore, we can simply copy the required section in a jail.local file and enable the jail to apply it.




By default, fail2ban works with iptables. However, this has been deprecated in favor of the firewalld. We need to configure fail2ban to work alongside `firewalld` instead of `iptables`.

```
mv /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/00-firewalld.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/00-firewalld.local
```


`NOTE`: Do not modify `jail.conf`. Instead, create a custom config:

```
cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```


_Create a minimal `/etc/fail2ban/jail.local` manually:_
```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

#### Create a Custom Jail (e.g., for SSD)


```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/sshd.local

[sshd]
enabled = true
port = ssh
#action = firewallcmd-ipset
maxretry = 3
bantime = 600
logpath = %(sshd_log)s
```



#### Create a Custom Jail (e.g., for MySQL)


```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/mysqld.local

[mysqld-auth]
enabled = true
filter   = mysqld-auth
port     = 3306
maxretry = 3
bantime = 300
logpath  = /var/log/mysql/mysqld.log
```



#### Create a Custom Jail (e.g., for Apache)

```
vim /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/apache.local

[apache-auth]
enabled = true
port = http,https
maxretry = 3
bantime = 600
logpath = /var/log/httpd/error_log
```




```
systemctl restart fail2ban
systemctl status fail2ban
```



### Test Fail2ban: 

- SSH: Try wrong password 03 times from another client.
- MySQL: Try failed login with wrong user/password (e.g., `mysql -u wronguser -p`).


```
fail2ban-client status


Status
|- Number of jail:      3
`- Jail list:   apache-auth, mysqld-auth, sshd
```


```
fail2ban-client status <jail_name>

fail2ban-client status sshd


Status for the jail: sshd
|- Filter
|  |- Currently failed: 0
|  |- Total failed:     3
|  `- Journal matches:  _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service + _COMM=sshd
`- Actions
   |- Currently banned: 1
   |- Total banned:     1
   `- Banned IP list:   192.168.10.192
```



_You can check the rules added by firewalld with the following command:_
```
firewall-cmd --list-rich-rules

### Output: 
rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.10.192" port port="ssh" protocol="tcp" reject type="icmp-port-unreachable"
```



```
tail -f /var/log/fail2ban.log
```



### Unban or Ban Manually:


_To unban a specific IP from a specific jail:_
```
fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip <IP_ADDRESS>

fail2ban-client set sshd unbanip 192.168.1.10
```


_To unban the IP address:_
```
fail2ban-client unban 192.168.1.10
```



_To ban the IP address:_
```
fail2ban-client set sshd banip <IP_ADDRESS>

fail2ban-client set sshd banip 192.168.1.100
```




Fail2Ban is a valuable tool for enhancing server security, effectively protecting against SSH service brute force attacks.
